Complied 
Go tool can run file directly, without VM(Virtual Machine)
Executables are different for OS

What
System apps to web apps - Cloud
Already in Production

Dont bring baggage
Yeah, I did that earlier
Similarties with lots of language - C, Java, Pascal

Object Oriented
Yes and No (it has struct but not classes)
What you see on the screen is the code

Missing
is it really missing?
No tr catch
lexer does a lot of work

//main.go file
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   fmt.Println("Hello World")
}

//Terminal
> go mod init hello
> go run main.go

> go help (for read the documenation)
> go help particular_command_name

# lexer means you are follwing the grammar of the any language.
